    <h1>What is Vtec ? </h1>
        
    <p>VTEC are a particular group of the bacterium Escherichia coli. The commonest member of this group of bacteria in Ireland is E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O26 is the next most common strain. Although most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals, this strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness.  

Around the world, the number of people infected with VTEC has been increasing since its discovery during the early 1980s. In 1996, Scotland had a large outbreak that affected over 500 people and 17 people died as a direct result of the outbreak. In the last couple of years in Ireland the number of reported E. coli O157 cases is on average 90 per year. VTEC is a notifiable disease in Ireland.</p>
        
<h1>How can you get VTEC?</h1>
        
        <p>VTEC are widespread in the environment and are present in healthy farmed, wild, and domesticated animals and birds and shed in their faeces. Cattle, sheep and goats are considered to be the main source among farmed animals.

Transmission to humans can occur as a result of direct contact with VTEC-contaminated faecal material, as a result of handling or petting animals or by exposure to faecally contaminated mud or vegetation during recreational activities. Exposure can also occur from consumption of water or food which is contaminated. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated if they come in contact with soil, animal faeces or manure which contains VTEC. The use of contaminated water for irrigation of food crops and washing of fruit and vegetables has also been identified as a transmission route for VTEC. Food of animal origin may be contaminated during milking (milk and dairy products) or during the slaughter process (meat and meat products).

Transmission between people is another way that VTEC can be spread. The organism is found in the faeces of infected people and it can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or hand-washing habits are inadequate.</p>

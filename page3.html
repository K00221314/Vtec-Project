    <h1>Prevention of Vtec. </h1>
        
   

        
<div class ="list2">
       <ul> The following list is ways to prevent Vtec:

   <li>•Thoroughly cook meat which has been minced (e.g. beef burgers) diced, rolled and blade- or needle-tenderised, i.e. until the interior or core is no longer pink and the juices run clear</li>
<li>•When eating out, check beef burgers are thoroughly cooked</li>
<li>•Refrigerate or freeze all meat products immediately on returning from shopping</li>
<li>•Prevent cross-contamination. Never let raw meat, or its juices, come into contact with cooked meat or any other food that will not be cooked before eating</li>
<li>•Wash hands and utensils after contact with raw foods</li>
<li>•Wash fruit and vegetables with drinking water before eating</li>
<li>•Young children, the frail elderly, and those people suffering from chronic diseases or with weakened immune systems should avoid the following: raw milk and dairy products made from raw milk; rare or undercooked meats; fermented uncooked meats, e.g. some salamis; and unpasteurised juices (unless freshly prepared) </li>
<li>•Only consume water of drinking quality. Users of private wells should ensure that the well is protected against entry of surface run-off and access by animals and that any disinfection system in place is properly maintained. Any well water that changes colour or taste, particularly after heavy rainfall should, as a precaution, be boiled before use for drinking, preparing food, making ice, or brushing teeth</li>
<li>•Wash hands with warm soapy water after using the toilet, changing nappies, and before preparing food, especially between handling raw and ready-to-eat food and after petting animals</li>
<li>•Ensure that people with diarrhoea, especially children, wash their hands carefully with soap and warm water after going to the toilet, and that people wash hands after changing soiled nappies</li>
<li>•Anyone with a diarrhoeal illness should avoid preparing food for others, swimming in public pools or lakes and sharing baths with others</li>
<li>•The national recommendations by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) regarding exclusion from work of infected food handlers should be strictly followed</li>
<li>•Children who are still infectious should not be allowed back into crèches or other childminding centres until they are free of infection</li>
<li>•Wash hands thoroughly after contact with animals and animal faeces</li>
